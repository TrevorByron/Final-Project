### Elevator Pitch:
* I plan to build a website for Old Mountain Tours and Explorations. The main purpose of the site is to be a resource for those looking to explore and "adventure". The goal is to help establish the Old Mountain brand as an adventure authority ultimately driving. The site will feature articles on bike packing, trail running, and international Travel. Sites that I will model after are: http://theradavist.com/ and http://www.bikepacking.com/ .

### who / what / when / where / why:
* This site exists for two clear reasons; 1.) to be a resource for those looking for help planning their next explore, 2.) to create Old Mountain as an authority in adventurous travel so that when they offer a lead/paid for trip more people are likely to sign up and pay for the service.

### Content :
* the content will be all things fastpacking, bikepacking and East Africa travel.

### SiteMap:
* The Main page - will be a long scroll of interesting articles/blog post all highly image driven. These will range from post about newly tried trails to run/bike, articles about packing for multi-day fast packing, or curated stories about travel.

* fast packing page - will sort the websites articles to show all articles that relate to fast packing.
* bikepacking page - will sort the websites articles to show only articles to do with bikepacking
* International page - will sort the websites articles to show only articles about international travel
